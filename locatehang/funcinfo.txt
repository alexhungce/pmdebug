panic oops_enter __stack_chk_fail:
A kernel panic has stopped the machine.

__stack_chk_fail:
Detected corruption of on-stack canary value.

printk:
This should not happen!

acpi_enter_sleep_state:
The kernel was transitioning to a suspend sleep state and never returned.
Generally this means that the machine did not wake up and get back to the
kernel resume successfully which normally indicates a BIOS issue.  However
we probably should have seen the hang in the final writes to the PM control
registers on the southbridge (e.g. in acpi_hw_write_pm1_control() so a little
more debugging is required to prove this really is a BIOS issue or not.

acpi_hw_write_pm1_control:
The kernel probably wrote to the southbridge the magic to put the machine
into suspend or hibernate and then the machine hung.  Generally this means
that the machine did not wake up and get back to the kernel resume successfully
which normally indicates a BIOS issue.
