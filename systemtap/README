== S3 debug scripts ==

=== How to Use ===

1. Install kernel debug .ddeb 
	This may take a while!

1.1) Create an /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.list by running the following line at a terminal: 

echo "deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com $(lsb_release -cs) main restricted universe multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.list

1.2) Import the debug symbol archive signing key: 

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 428D7C01

1.3) Then run:

sudo apt-get update

1.4) Download and install the debug kernel, e.g.

sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.38-8-generic-dbgsym

Ensure you kernel version matches. Probably a reboot is a good idea. [ not tested this ] 

2. Run the s3test script

	./s3test 

optional args:

	-f, --flash funcname
		flash the keyboard LEDs when we execute one of
		the s3 instrumented functions

	-b, --beep
		beep the speaker when we execute one of the
		s3 instrumented functions
	
	-r, --reboot
		reboot the machine when we execute one of the
		s3 instrumented functions

	-s	automatically suspend the machine

3. Gather the data

	Full trace log in s3-systemtap.log
	Function traces in s3-trace.log
		note that some inline'd functions and
		return paths cannot be traced.
	Device suspend/resume state in s3-devices.log
	Task suspend/resume state in s3-tasks.log
	Test results in s3-test.log

If the machine hangs, reboot the machine and run
the 'locatehang' program. This will convert the RTC hash back
into a function hash and then lookup and determine the last
instrumented function executed before the machine locked up.

4. Next step...

	I'm going to write a s3diagnose tool that will look
at the logs and try and give some kind of intelligent diagnoses.
