== S3 debug scripts ==

=== How to Use ===

1. Install kernel debug .ddeb 
	This may take a while!

1.1) Create an /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.list by running the following line at a terminal: 

echo "deb http://ddebs.ubuntu.com $(lsb_release -cs) main restricted universe multiverse" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ddebs.list

1.2) Import the debug symbol archive signing key: 

sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 428D7C01

1.3) Then run:

sudo apt-get update

1.4) Download and install the debug kernel, e.g.

sudo apt-get install linux-image-2.6.38-8-generic-dbgsym

Ensure you kernel version matches. Probably a reboot is a good idea. [ not tested this ] 

2. Run the s3test script

	./s3test 

optional args:

	-f, --flash funcname
		flash the keyboard LEDs when we execute one of
		the s3 instrumented functions

	-b, --beep
		beep the speaker when we execute one of the
		s3 instrumented functions
	
	-r, --reboot
		reboot the machine when we execute one of the
		s3 instrumented functions

	-s	automatically suspend the machine

3. Gather the data

	Full trace log in s3-systemtap.log
	Function traces in s3-trace.log
		note that some inline'd functions and
		return paths cannot be traced.
	Device suspend/resume state in s3-devices.log
	Task suspend/resume state in s3-tasks.log
	Test results in s3-test.log

If the machine hangs, reboot the machine and run
the 'locatehang' program. This will convert the RTC hash back
into a function hash and then lookup and determine the last
instrumented function executed before the machine locked up.

4. Extra goodies.

Some PCs allow one to beep the internal speaker, and thus we can use old
school modem techniques to transmit debug messages over the speaker.  
One requires a modem to recieve the data on another machine:

sudo apt-get install minimodem

and run minimodem:

minimodem -q --rx 110

(e.g. receive at 110 baud)

and arrange a microphone from this machine to listen to the output from
the machine you are debugging.

Then use the following options on s3test:

--minimodem --minimodem-baud=110
	one can use 110, 300, 600 or 1200 baud settings. your milage may vary.

..this will enable the basic minimodem debugging.

And one can use the following for more verbose output:

--minimodem-funcs
	dump out functions being entered/exited
--minimodem-tasks
	dump out names of tasks being frozen/thawed
--minimodem-tests
	dump out results from simple S3 sanity tests
--minimodem-devs
	dump out names of devices being suspend/resumes

but it can take time to dump this data out.

5. Next step...

	I'm going to write a s3diagnose tool that will look
at the logs and try and give some kind of intelligent diagnoses.
